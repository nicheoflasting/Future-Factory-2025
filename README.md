## Feature: Reset Password For Users

This repository contains the code I used for the Youtube tutorial Reset Password For Users: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9bfts9ZFjs 

* In this project course, I obtained this task in my group. By sending password recovery link through SMTP email method and PHP file, users can recover their account with the change of a new password.

* In this feature I used XAMPP and phpAdmin to connect and storing data from account creation. To run on browser, it is necessary to turn on Apache and MySQL in XAMPP. Then, access the PHP file with "localhost"

* **Important**: The coding folder needs to be placed in htdocs folder of XAMPP
